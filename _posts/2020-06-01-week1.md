During the first week of my DREU project, I familiarized myself with the university and the surrounding area. I met with Dr. Crawford and my mentors to discuss the project details, gaining a comprehensive understanding of its requirements. I began exploring the APIs and documentation for Makeblock and CyberPi, which are crucial for my project. This initial research phase laid a strong foundation for the technical work ahead.

In the second week, I started experimenting with various sensors from the Keyestudio Sensor Kit, focusing on data collection methods. I created multiple programs to detect touch, movement, sound, and voltage. Additionally, I developed a way to connect CyberPi to Wi-Fi for data collection. I also programmed line plots and box plots to visualize the collected data. Here are a few examples of the programs I created:

1. **Touch Sensor Program:** Detected and displayed touch inputs.
2. **Movement Sensor Program:** Captured motion data.
3. **Sound Sensor Program:** Measured and visualized sound levels.
4. **Voltage Sensor Program:** Monitored voltage changes.
5. **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Enabled data collection over the network and visualized it using line and box plots.
