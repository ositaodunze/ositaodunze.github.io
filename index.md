# CyberPi Sensor Integration for Education

**Problem:**
Educational software that leverages physical computing devices and sensors needs more exploration.

**Approach:**
This project involves:

- Integrating Makeblock and CyberPi with Keyestudio sensors.
- Emphasizing data collection and visualization to enhance educational experiences.
- Creating applications that show real-time data use from sensors like temperature, humidity, and motion.

**Expected Outcome:**
A comprehensive conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program, detailing the system's architecture and the educational impact of using CyberPi for data-driven learning.
